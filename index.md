# Standard

The Amsterdam development standard documents the specific technology, tools and processes that DataPunt teams use to build and operate services.

## Comply or explain

These standards are agreements to make it easier to work together, if there is a good reason to not follow one of the standards you are free to diverge, however you **must** explain in your commit message, pull request or `README` why you did this.
