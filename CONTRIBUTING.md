# Contributing

The development standard is here to make it easier to be a developer for the City of Amsterdam. As our organisations and technology change the development standard should change with it. Everyone is invited to propose additions or removals from the standard.

The standard is versioned using GitHub. If you are unfamilliar with how to write Markdown and use GitHub there are excellent interactive tutiorials at [lab.github.com](https://lab.github.com/).

## Versioning of the development standard

Because this repository is an agreement with the entire team changes need to be managed and communicated properly. For this reason this project has a published version on the `master` branch, a next version on the `develop` branch and feature branches for new features and Pull Requests.
